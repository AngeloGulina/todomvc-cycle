# Cycle

A web application framework using the Reactive Model-View-Intent architecture and Virtual
DOM Rendering.

* **Unidirectional Dataflow**: based on the Model-View-Intent architecture, data moves
  from Model to View, events move from View to Intent, and Intent sends "user intentions"
  to the Model. They are tied together as a cycle.
* **Purely Reactive**: all components are event-driven and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)
  is a hard dependency, which simplifies all code related to events, asynchronicity, and
  errors.
* **Virtual DOM Rendering**: Views re-render completely whenever Models emit any event.
  The use of [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) keeps performance
  optimal by patching the actual DOM with only the minimum necessary changes.
* **MVI is functional**: each component in the MVI cycle behaves like a function,
  receiving events as input, and outputting events. No side effects. This makes it
  convenient for composing with other components, or for automating tests.

## Example

```javascript
var HelloModel = Cycle.defineModel(['changeName$'], function (intent) {
  return {
    name$: intent.changeName$.startWith('')
  };
});

var HelloView = Cycle.defineView(['name$'], function (model) {
  return {
    vtree$: model.name$
      .map(function (name) {
        return Cycle.h('div', {}, [
          Cycle.h('label', 'Name:'),
          Cycle.h('input', {
            'attributes': {'type': 'text'},
            'ev-input': 'inputText$'
          }),
          Cycle.h('hr'),
          Cycle.h('h1', 'Hello ' + name)
        ]);
      }),
    events: ['inputText$']
  };
});

var HelloIntent = Cycle.defineIntent(['inputText$'], function (view) {
  return {
    changeName$: view.inputText$
      .map(function (ev) { return ev.target.value; })
  };
});

Cycle.renderEvery(HelloView.vtree$, '.js-container');
Cycle.link(HelloModel, HelloView, HelloIntent);
```

Notice that each of the 3 components has a neighbour component as input, and each outputs
an object mostly containing Rx Observables. At the bottom, `Cycle.renderEvery` subscribes
to changes of `HelloView.vtree$` and renders those virtual elements into `.js-container`
in the DOM. `Cycle.link` just ties all three Model, View, and Intent together by telling
them that they depend on each other circularly.

## Installing through npm

`npm install cyclejs`

## Installing through Bower

`bower install cycle`

## Learn more

Model-View-Intent is similar to Flux, and Virtual DOM Rendering is inspired by React,
however there are several differences worth paying attention. Read the [seminal blog post
that lead to the creation of Cycle.js](http://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom).

It has [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)
as hard dependencies. Cycle is a "glue" framework providing helpers for building the
Model-View-Intent architecture properly with those technologies. Cycle's code itself is
still under 300 lines of code only.

## Disclaimer

Cycle is in alpha mode, many changes to the API will likely occur before v1.0 is released.
Use this framework only for experiments before that. PS: we don't want to stay as alpha
forever, either. ;)
